# Alexandria
First online code version of Alexandria.dk

## Caveat
The project was started in 2000. Some of the code might be from that era.

The code ought to be PHP7 compatible. MySQL 5+ is needed as RDBMS.

## Install
Remember to check out the config files under `includes/`. 

Database schema is present in [structure.sql](./structure.sql). No data is present, only the structure.

## TODO
* Config file
  * Dynamic domain name
  * Paths to downloadable files
* Export/import function (with internal stripped)
* Bulk download of downloadable files
* And much more ...
